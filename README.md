# Alzheimer AI Mobile App 🧠📱

This repository contains an academic project focused on the development of a mobile application based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the segmentation and classification of Alzheimer’s disease using MRI images.

## 📌 Project Overview
Alzheimer’s disease represents a major public health challenge. This project proposes an AI-assisted mobile application that helps neurologists analyze MRI scans, visualize affected brain regions using heatmaps, classify disease stages, and generate understandable reports for patients and families.

The project follows the Design Thinking methodology:
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

## ⚙️ Main Features
- MRI image upload and preprocessing
- AI-based brain segmentation and classification
- Heatmap visualization of affected regions
- Alzheimer stage classification (mild, moderate, severe)
- Dual reports: medical and simplified patient version
- Patient history and disease progression tracking
- PDF export and email sharing

## 🧪 Methodology
- Deep Learning models (CNN, attention-based architectures)
- MRI-based segmentation and classification
- Explainable AI (XAI) using heatmaps
- User-centered design using Design Thinking

## 📂 Repository Structure
See folder structure for model, prototype, and documentation.

## 📊 Testing
The prototype was tested with neurologists and medical students, validating usability, clarity, and clinical relevance.

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations
- No real patient data is included.
- MRI data must be anonymized.
- The system is intended as a clinical decision support tool, not as a replacement for medical diagnosis.

## 📚 References
